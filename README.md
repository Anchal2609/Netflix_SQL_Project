## Problem Statement 
Netflix hosts thousands of titles worldwide, creating challenges in understanding content trends, regional production, and audience suitability. This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's movies and TV shows data using SQL. The goal is to extract valuable insights and answer various business questions based on the dataset. The following README provides a detailed account of the project's objectives, business problems, solutions, findings, and conclusions.


## Objectives

- Analyze the distribution of content types (movies vs TV shows).
- Identify the most common ratings for movies and TV shows.
- List and analyze content based on release years, countries, and durations.
- Explore and categorize content based on specific criteria and keywords.

## Dataset

The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:

## Five Key Steps:

1. Data Collection:
The project began by gathering a comprehensive Netflix dataset from Kaggle, which contained detailed information about movies and TV shows — including title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, duration, and genre. This dataset served as the foundation for the entire analysis, providing diverse attributes needed to explore Netflix’s content distribution and trends.

2. Data Cleaning (Excel):
Using Microsoft Excel, the dataset was cleaned and refined to ensure data quality and consistency. This included removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing date and duration formats. Excel’s filtering and formula tools were utilized to efficiently inspect, correct, and validate entries before further analysis.

3. Data Processing (Excel):
Excel was also used to preprocess the cleaned data. Functions like text-to-columns, conditional formatting, and pivot operations helped transform raw data into a structured format. Columns were categorized by type (e.g., content type, release year, rating), and irrelevant or incomplete data entries were removed to improve accuracy in subsequent analysis.

4. Data Analysis (SQL):
The processed dataset was then imported into SQL for structured querying and deeper analysis. SQL queries were executed to identify key insights such as the count of movies vs. TV shows, distribution of ratings, most common production countries, and content trends over time. SQL’s aggregation and filtering capabilities enabled efficient exploration of large data subsets.

5. Insights Generation:
After the analysis, insights were interpreted and summarized to support business understanding. These findings revealed trends in Netflix’s global content portfolio — including the dominance of movies, prevalent content ratings (like TV-MA and PG-13), and major production hubs (India, USA, and UK). The insights derived provided a foundation for data-driven strategies to enhance audience engagement and content planning.


## Findings and Conclusion

- **Content Distribution:** The dataset contains a diverse range of movies and TV shows with varying ratings and genres.
- **Common Ratings:** Insights into the most common ratings provide an understanding of the content's target audience.
- **Geographical Insights:** The top countries and the average content releases by India highlight regional content distribution.
- **Content Categorization:** Categorizing content based on specific keywords helps in understanding the nature of content available on Netflix.
